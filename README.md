In terminal run:

python boundingBoxer.py

This is a simple python script to input number of bounding boxes to create on the image and the coordinates on which to draw those boudning boxes. 
This is useful to check the accuracy of a Vision large language model (vllm) ability to accurately output bounding box coordinates when the model is asked to do so by the user. After image is displayed with bounding boxes drawn press any key to proceed again. User will be asked if you want to go again with either yes/no.

Will need opencv installed.

'''pip install opencv-python'''

Only tested with ubuntu thus far.
