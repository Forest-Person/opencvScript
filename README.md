Will need opencv installed.

'''pip install opencv-python'''


This is a simple python script to input number of bounding boxes to create on the image and the coordinates on which to draw those boudning boxes. 
This is useful to check the accuracy of a Vision large language model (vllm) ability to accurately output bounding box coordinates when asked to do so by the user.
